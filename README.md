For this project, we've decided to use kanban as our development method.

We chose a kanban workflow because we wanted a development process that supports continuous delivery but we didn't want the rigidity of scrum. For example, we didn't want fixed length or locked-in sprints. Because of the nature and the timeline of the project, we want to be able to reprioritize work quickly.

To support our kanban process, we plan to use a Trello board to track work in progress. We want to institute work-in-progress limits, so every person only has one small-to-medium item in "Doing" at a time. We also plan to have standups regularly (at this point, 2x a week), where each member of the team will review work completed, work upcoming, and any blockers.

We plan to continuously deliver and deploy work, and we will set up continuous integration on our project.

###  Project tracking:
(Annie)

As mentioned above, we plan to use a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/xqkROHN7/teamworldbot) for project tracking. We chose Trello as our project tracking software because it's easy to use, it supports a kanban workflow, and because members of our team already have experience with it.
